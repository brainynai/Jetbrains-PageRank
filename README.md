This project was completed for beta-testing a new project for Jetbrains Academy's Python track. I served as Jetbrains' freelance reviewer and was later further commissioned to make my edits on their site. 

The intent of the project was to emulate and understand the PageRank algorithm which Google invented to provide optimized search results. The project focused on a small-scale "internet" of sites, and the program would determine how to rank them based on how the sites linked to one another, using relative quantities of links to determine which sites were the most important, and by extension, which sites' outgoing links carried the most significance. The end result of the program was an output vector showing the ranking order of the various sites. 

This project uses linear algebra tools available through numpy.
